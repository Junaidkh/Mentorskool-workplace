Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. \n","\n","# **What is Beautiful Soup?**\n","Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LygJJ_Mj7aNJ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# start coding below "],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"02f0ODF1cMi2","colab_type":"code","outputId":"6debca36-751e-452b-eb11-577abfbb9640","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584951053896,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1819,"user":{"displayName":"Junaid Khan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgrgI-h6rFzzsasKd284HfP814qzCpmmcL5NOk-og=s64","userId":"02392684751069875389"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":382}},"source":["from requests import get #importing get function from request module\n","\n","#This is the url of the webpage which we want to scrap \n","url = 'http://www.imdb.com/search/title?release_date=2017&sort=num_votes,desc&page=1' \n","\n","#Here in 'response' we have stored the webpage\n","response = get(url)\n","\n","# now we printed the text. \n","print(response.text[:500])"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n","\n","\n","<!DOCTYPE html>\n","<html\n","    xmlns:og=\"http://ogp.me/ns#\"\n","    xmlns:fb=\"http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml\">\n","    <head>\n","         \n","        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n","        <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n","\n","    <meta name=\"apple-itunes-app\" content=\"app-id=342792525, app-argument=imdb:///?src=mdot\">\n","\n","\n","\n","        <script type=\"text/javascript\">var IMDbTimer={starttime: new Date().getTime(),pt:'java'};</script>\n","\n","<script>\n","    if (typeof uet == 'function') {\n","      uet(\"bb\", \"LoadTitle\"\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vjlrEXLyfl9S","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0c964b62-ecde-4d65-96ca-e9ca9f376fe5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584951054712,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2617,"user":{"displayName":"Junaid Khan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgrgI-h6rFzzsasKd284HfP814qzCpmmcL5NOk-og=s64","userId":"02392684751069875389"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","\n","# now with the help of html parser we will get the text file.\n","html_soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n","type(html_soup)"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["bs4.BeautifulSoup"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EyM2LzQxTy71","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# **Html Parser**\n","\n","According to wikipedia, Parsing or syntactic analysis is the process of analysing a string of symbols, either in natural language or in computer languages, according to the rules of a formal grammar. The term parsing comes from Latin pars (orationis), meaning part (of speech).\n","\n","In your case, HTML parsing is basically: taking in HTML code and extracting relevant information like the title of the page, paragraphs in the page, headings in the page, links, bold text etc.\n","Parsers:\n","\n","A computer program that parses content is called a parser. There are in general 2 kinds of parsers:\n","\n","Top-down parsing- Top-down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for parse trees using a top-down expansion of the given formal grammar rules. Tokens are consumed from left to right. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate ambiguity by expanding all alternative right-hand-sides of grammar rules.\n","\n","Bottom-up parsing - A parser can start with the input and attempt to rewrite it to the start symbol. Intuitively, the parser attempts to locate the most basic elements, then the elements containing these, and so on. LR parsers are examples of bottom-up parsers. Another term used for this type of parser is Shift-Reduce parsing.\n","A few example parsers:\n","Top-down parsers:\n","\n","    Recursive descent parser\n","    LL parser (Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation)\n","    Earley parser\n","\n","Bottom-up parsers:\n","\n","    Precedence parser\n","        Operator-precedence parser\n","        Simple precedence parser\n","    BC (bounded context) parsing\n","    LR parser (Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation)\n","        Simple LR (SLR) parser\n","        LALR parser\n","        Canonical LR (LR(1)) parser\n","        GLR parser\n","    CYK parser\n","    Recursive ascent parser\n","\n","Example parser:\n","\n","Here's an example HTML parser in python:\n","\n","from HTMLParser import HTMLParser\n","\n","# create a subclass and override the handler methods\n","class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):\n","    def handle_starttag(self, tag, attrs):\n","        print \"Encountered a start tag:\", tag\n","    def handle_endtag(self, tag):\n","        print \"Encountered an end tag :\", tag\n","    def handle_data(self, data):\n","        print \"Encountered some data  :\", data\n","\n","# instantiate the parser and fed it some HTML\n","parser = MyHTMLParser()\n","parser.feed('<html><head><title>Test</title></head>'\n","            '<body><h1>Parse me!</h1></body></html>')\n","\n","Here's the output:\n","\n","    Encountered a start tag: html\n","    Encountered a start tag: head\n","    Encountered a start tag: title\n","    Encountered some data  : Test\n","    Encountered an end tag : title\n","    Encountered an end tag : head\n","    Encountered a start tag: body\n","    Encountered a start tag: h1\n","    Encountered some data  : Parse me!\n","    Encountered an end tag : h1\n","    Encountered an end tag : body\n","    Encountered an end tag : html\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VZyDtUqzSUZ0","colab_type":"code","outputId":"6f0f3e8e-2f9e-4d6d-8770-b61f530ee92a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584951054715,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2608,"user":{"displayName":"Junaid Khan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgrgI-h6rFzzsasKd284HfP814qzCpmmcL5NOk-og=s64","userId":"02392684751069875389"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":52}},"source":["movie_containers = html_soup.find_all('div', class_ = 'lister-item mode-advanced')\n","# find_all: returns the resultset object which we have passes into the function\n","\n","print(type(movie_containers))\n","print(len(movie_containers))"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'bs4.element.ResultSet'>\n","50\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qm6dUobdTm-W","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# creating the variable and initializing it with the first movie object.\n","first_movie = movie_containers[0]"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XLBV3wyedfEI","colab_type":"text"},"source":["*Now we need to find:*\n","\n","1.
